# ButterflyMX Android Code Challenge!

<P>Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to conduct the ButterflyMX Android code challenge. Please use this as a foundation to help you save time setting up your workspace; this project already contains some common dependencies and frameworks used in most Android projects.
If there are other dependencies and/or frameworks that you'd like to introduce/use please feel free to add them!</P>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Kotlin Ext</li>
  <li>Kotlin Coroutines</li>
  <li>Retrofit</li>
  <li>GSON</li>
  <li>Glide</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Requirements</h2>
 <p>You will be building a simple list view using the API shown in the Links section.
  This api contains a collection of different Star War characters and attributes for each, for the purpose of this demo we are only interested in the following attributes.
  
  <ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>image</li>
  <li>species</li>
  <li>affiliations</li>
 </ul>
  
  1. Your application should return a list of all Star War characters and display them in the listview.
  2. Each character shown in the list should include: An image of the character, name of character & species.
  
  If there is enough time left we would also like you to implement a sorting feature.
  
  1. Sort the list of Star Wars characters in Ascending and descending order by Name.
  2. Sort the list of Star Wars characters in Ascending and descending order by Species.
